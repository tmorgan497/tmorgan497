- <a href="https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/29492">#29492</a>: CREATE RLS policy fails after timeout with no error
- <a href="https://github.com/eadwinCode/django-ninja-extra/issues/202">#202</a>: Throttle response message customization
- <a href="https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui/issues/1782">#1782</a>: Individual row and cell theme coloring request
